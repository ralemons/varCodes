# varCodes
Repo holding various codes of all different purposes

This repo is under the GNU Lesser General Public License. I haven't taken the time to add this notice or the author to each of the files and I doubt I ever will. Feel free to fork, clone, distribute, etc. this repo as long as you add the notice as required by the LGPL. I am sure in legal terms that I am doing something wrong with licensing but frankly I only care that the sprit of the LGPL is respected for each file.

Some of the code in this repo is designed to work with classes and codes that are kept in private repos and/or specific scientific devices. I don't intend to make all of that readily available but feel free to contact me for if you are curious about it. The main point of this repo is as a place to store my code, build a history of changes, and allow others to see and use whatever I have written.
